# PyManufSol
Framework for symbolically generating manufactured solutions satisfying prescribed conditions with applications to code verification.
This is the first version of the software that should be considered as a beta version as many improvements could be done. It is associated to the companion conference paper entitled "A GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR SYMBOLICALLY GENERATING MANUFACTURED SOLUTIONS SATISFYING PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS - APPLICATION TO TWO-PHASE FLOWS EQUATIONS", presented at the VI International Conference on Numerical and Symbolic Computation: Developments and Applications (SYMCOMP 2023), March 30-31, 2023.
